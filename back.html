        <div class="square box1">Backing has always been for the brave. CIG has had some rocky periods and people have demanded refunds. There is one fact that new backers have to appreciate, you have a plethora oof evidence that led you to this choice, but the older backers had nothing but a demo in 2012 a speech and a lot of wild promises, some of which were promptly broken. </div>
        <div class="square box2">Looking at potential pros and cons.</div>
        <div class="square box3">Pros:<br>
            You will be able to help push the direction of the game with your feedback<br>
            You will be part of a growing community<br>
            You get to experience the evolution of each game mechanics as they are introduced and influence each step<br>
            You’ll gain rare insight of the development cycle<br>
            As a backer you’ll have a knowledge head start over any new player, even with a ship disadvantage<br> 
            </div>
        <div class="square box4">Cons:<br>
            The wipes really do hurt<br>
            The game is currently waiting for key technologies to be implemented which means missing features and poor performance<br>
            The backer community is literally seen as a cult, it’s almost up there with claiming to be a Trump supporter after January 6th<br>
            The pressure from your subconscious to continually increase your pledge is great, you will constantly see new things you want<br>
            Server and client crashes are brutal, never start a trade knowing it’s 100% of your funds, you can lose it all real fast<br>
            </div>
        <div class="square box5">Conclusion: This choice is for the adventurous, win or lose you’ll experience a journey. But remember, no matter how much you put in you won’t get any money back out. Nor should you put in any money you will regret not having later. The money you give to CIG will be gone, what you get back isn’t something you can hold, nor will it keep your stomach filled. But I hope that at the end the experience will be worth it.</div>
