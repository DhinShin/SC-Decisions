        <div class="square box1">First, the ‘wait and see’ option. I honestly see this the prudent choice, the choice of the realist.
            CIG have received more than $400m at this point, and they’ll receive even more soon. They don’t need your money to finish either game, and until they are released, both titles are promises with no defined timescales and no real surety of completion.
            </div>
        <div class="square box2">Looking at potential pros and cons.</div>
        <div class="square box3">Pros:<br>
            If the game is good, there is no risk of buying into a dead product<br>
            You will get to buy after seeing final reviews<br>
            You will get a refined and optimised product<br>
            You will join after the soul-destroying data wipes<br>
            You will have no pressure to buy new ships as they are released, just earn it in game<br>
        </div>
            
        <div class="square box4">Cons:<br>
            You won’t get to contribute anything to the final game<br>
            You can never be part of the testing community<br>
            You will only explore the game in its finished state<br>
            You will have no Alpha stories from before features were implemented<br>
            You will feel no excitement from the current three-month patch cycle CIG are working with<br>
        </div>
        <div class="square box5">Conclusion: It could be scepticism, frugality, or maybe even total conviction that this is a scam. But it almost goes without saying, that the you of today, is not a Citizen of today. Maybe you’ll back at a later point, maybe you’ll wait until the finished game, or maybe Star Citizen will never reach a point where you consider it worth your time. But in any case, I hope you find a game you love playing soon. Star Citizen isn’t the only game worth talking about, but it’s the only one on this page.</div>

    <!-- <div><h2>Wait & See</h2>
        <p>Honestly, I see waiting as the more prudent choice, however it's the choice of the skeptic.

        CIG have received more than $400m at this point, and they’ll receive even more soon. They don’t need your money to finish either game, and until they are released, both titles are promises with no defined timescales and no real surety of completion.
        <br>
        The needed specs are very high, and even when you meet them, performance is still low.
        <br>
        Any progress currently made is subject to wipes, and while not as regular as before, CIG can’t promise long term persistence.
        <br>
        Buying ships with cash is seen as Pay2Win, it's also currently the only way to insure your climb back from wipes isn’t too far.
